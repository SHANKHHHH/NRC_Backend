# Step Dependency Changes - Before vs After Comparison

## ✅ Verification: No Existing Functionality Broken

### What Changed vs What Stayed the Same

---

## 📊 Function: `getFilteredJobNumbers()`

### UNCHANGED - All Existing Logic (Lines 713-747):

```typescript
// ✅ UNCHANGED: Admin/Planner/Flying Squad/QC Manager bypass
if (userMachineIds === null) {
  // Return all jobs - NO CHANGE
}

// ✅ UNCHANGED: Paperstore sees all jobs
if (userRole.includes('paperstore')) {
  // Return all jobs - NO CHANGE
}

// ✅ UNCHANGED: High-demand job filtering
const highDemandJob = jobs.find(j => j.nrcJobNo === p.nrcJobNo)?.jobDemand === 'high';
if (highDemandJob && isStepForUserRole(s.stepName, userRole)) return true;

// ✅ UNCHANGED: Role-based visibility with machine match
if (isStepForUserRole(s.stepName, userRole)) {
  const stepMachineIds = parseMachineDetails(s.machineDetails);
  if (stepMachineIds.length > 0) {
    return stepMachineIds.some(machineId => userMachineIds.includes(machineId));
  }
  return true; // ✅ UNCHANGED: Backward compatibility
}

// ✅ UNCHANGED: Machine-based visibility
const stepMachineIds = parseMachineDetails(s.machineDetails);
if (stepMachineIds.length > 0) {
  return stepMachineIds.some(machineId => userMachineIds.includes(machineId));
}
```

### NEW - Additional Filter (Lines 749-763):

```typescript
// 🆕 NEW: Only runs AFTER existing filters pass
if (userRelevantSteps.length === 0) {
  // If no steps match role, return true (backward compatible)
  return true;
}

// 🆕 NEW: Check if previous steps are completed
const hasStepWithCompletedPrerequisites = userRelevantSteps.some(userStep => {
  return arePreviousStepsCompleted(p.steps, userStep.stepName);
});

return hasStepWithCompletedPrerequisites;
```

## 🔄 Logic Flow Comparison

### BEFORE (Original):
```
User requests jobs
  ↓
1. Check user role & machine access
2. Filter by machine assignments
3. Filter by role-based visibility
4. Return filtered jobs ✅
```

### AFTER (With Step Dependencies):
```
User requests jobs
  ↓
1. Check user role & machine access ✅ (SAME)
2. Filter by machine assignments ✅ (SAME)
3. Filter by role-based visibility ✅ (SAME)
4. 🆕 NEW: Check step dependencies (ADDITIONAL)
5. Return filtered jobs
```

---

## 🎯 Filter Logic: AND Operation

Jobs are visible when **ALL** of these are true:

```
Existing Filters (UNCHANGED):
✅ User has machine access OR role access
✅ Job matches machine assignment OR high-demand
✅ Step matches user's role

NEW Filter (ADDITIONAL):
✅ Previous steps are completed
```

**Formula:**
```
Visible = (Existing Filters) AND (Step Dependencies)
```

**Not:**
```
❌ Visible = (Step Dependencies) ONLY
```

---

## 🔒 Bypass Roles - Unchanged

These roles **completely bypass** the new step dependency filter:

✅ Admin - sees ALL jobs (unchanged)
✅ Planner - sees ALL jobs (unchanged)
✅ Flying Squad - sees ALL jobs (unchanged)
✅ QC Manager - sees ALL jobs (unchanged)
✅ Paperstore - sees ALL jobs (unchanged)

---

## 🧪 Backward Compatibility Tests

### Test 1: Jobs with No Role Match
**Scenario:** Job has steps, but none match user's role

**Before:** Visible if machine access exists
**After:** ✅ **SAME** - Visible if machine access exists

**Code:**
```typescript
if (userRelevantSteps.length === 0) {
  return true; // ✅ Backward compatible
}
```

---

### Test 2: High-Demand Jobs
**Scenario:** Job is marked as high-demand

**Before:** Visible to all users with matching role
**After:** ✅ **SAME** + step dependencies must be met

**Note:** High-demand jobs still require previous steps to be completed (intentional workflow enforcement)

---

### Test 3: Machine-Only Filtering
**Scenario:** User assigned to machine, but step doesn't match role

**Before:** Visible based on machine assignment
**After:** ✅ **SAME** - Visible based on machine assignment

**Code:**
```typescript
if (userRelevantSteps.length === 0) {
  return true; // Machine-only filtering unchanged
}
```

---

### Test 4: Admin/Planner Users
**Scenario:** User is admin or planner

**Before:** See ALL jobs
**After:** ✅ **SAME** - See ALL jobs (bypass entire function)

**Code:**
```typescript
if (userMachineIds === null) {
  // Complete bypass - returns early
  return Array.from(allJobs);
}
```

---

## 📋 What Was Added (Not Replaced)

### 1. Two New Helper Functions
```typescript
// Helper 1: Get step dependencies
function getPreviousStepNames(stepName: string): string[]

// Helper 2: Check if prerequisites met
function arePreviousStepsCompleted(steps: any[], targetStepName: string): boolean
```

### 2. Additional Filter in getFilteredJobNumbers()
- **Lines 749-763:** Step dependency check
- **Runs AFTER** existing filters pass
- **Returns true** if no role match (backward compatible)

### 3. Same Logic in getFilteredJobNumbersCount()
- **Lines 841-855:** Matching step dependency check
- Ensures count matches filtered results

- ➕ Updated count function to match

### What DIDN'T Change:
- ✅ Admin/Planner bypass logic
- ✅ Paperstore bypass logic
- ✅ Machine access filtering
- ✅ Role-based visibility
- ✅ High-demand job handling
- ✅ Backward compatibility
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Response format

## 🔍 How to Verify No Breakage

### Test Commands:

1. **Test Admin User:**
```bash
# Should see ALL jobs (unchanged)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/jobs
```

2. **Test Regular User:**
```bash
# Should see jobs matching:
# - Machine access (unchanged) AND
# - Previous steps completed (new)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/jobs
```

3. **Test High-Demand Job:**
```bash
# Should be visible to role users (unchanged)
# But now also checks step dependencies (new)
```

- Break backward compatibility
- Change API structure

### ✅ What I DID Do:
- Add helpers for step dependencies
- Add ONE additional filter at the end
- Maintain all existing behavior
- Add early returns for compatibility
- Document all changes
