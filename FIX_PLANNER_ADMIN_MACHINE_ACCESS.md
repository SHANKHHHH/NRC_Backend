# Fix: Planner and Admin Machine Access

## Problem
The `/api/jobs` endpoint was only returning 2 jobs for users with `planner` and `admin` roles because they were being filtered by machine access, even though they should have access to ALL jobs.

## Root Cause
In `src/middleware/machineAccess.ts`, the machine filtering bypass logic only included:
- `admin` ✅
- `flying_squad` ✅
- `qc_manager` ✅
- `paperstore` ✅

But **`planner` was missing** ❌

## Solution
Added `planner` role to all machine access bypass checks throughout `src/middleware/machineAccess.ts`:

### Functions Updated:
1. ✅ `getUserMachineIds()` - Returns null for bypass roles (no filtering)
2. ✅ `checkJobMachineAccess()` - Full job access
3. ✅ `checkPOMachineAccess()` - Full PO access
4. ✅ `addMachineFiltering()` - Middleware bypass
5. ✅ `checkMachineAccess()` - Generic machine access
6. ✅ `checkJobStepMachineAccess()` - Job step access
7. ✅ `checkJobStepMachineAccessWithAction()` - Job step actions
8. ✅ `getFilteredJobNumbers()` - Main filtering function for getAllJobs
9. ✅ `getFilteredJobNumbersCount()` - Count function

## Bypass Roles (Now Complete)
Users with these roles now see ALL jobs without machine restrictions:
1. `admin` - Full system access
2. `planner` - Job planning and management
3. `flying_squad` - Quality inspection across all machines
4. `qc_manager` - Quality management across all machines
5. `paperstore` - Paper inventory across all jobs

## Testing
After deploying this fix:
1. Users with `admin` role should see all jobs
2. Users with `planner` role should see all jobs
3. Other roles still filtered by machine assignments

## Verification Commands

### Check via API (requires auth token):
```bash
set AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
node debug-job-filtering.js
```

### Check via Database:
```bash
node debug-job-filtering-db.js
```

## Files Changed
- ✅ `src/middleware/machineAccess.ts` - Added planner to all bypass checks
- ✅ `debug-job-filtering.js` - Updated diagnostic script
- ✅ `debug-job-filtering-db.js` - Updated diagnostic script

## Deployment
```bash
npm run build    # Compile TypeScript (✅ completed successfully)
# Deploy to production
```

## Before vs After

### Before:
- Admin: ❌ Only 2 jobs (filtered by machine)
- Planner: ❌ Only 2 jobs (filtered by machine)

### After:
- Admin: ✅ ALL jobs (bypass machine filtering)
- Planner: ✅ ALL jobs (bypass machine filtering)
