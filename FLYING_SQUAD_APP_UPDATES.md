# Flying Squad App Updates

## 🎯 Overview
Updated the Flutter app to work with the new Flying Squad backend restrictions and API endpoints.

## 🔧 Backend Changes Applied

### 1. **Flying Squad Permissions Middleware**
- Created `src/middleware/flyingSquadPermissions.ts`
- Restricts Flying Squad to only QC operations
- Blocks step status, machine details, and timing updates

### 2. **Enhanced Role Utilities**
- Updated `src/utils/roleUtils.ts` with Flying Squad specific permissions
- Added methods to check what Flying Squad can/cannot do

### 3. **Protected All Update Endpoints**
- Updated all step controllers with Flying Squad restrictions
- Added QC-only endpoint: `/api/job-planning/:nrcJobNo/steps/:stepNo/qc`
- Protected job planning routes with middleware

### 4. **Fixed Flying Squad API Endpoints**
- Added missing endpoints: `/api/flying-squad/qc-pending` and `/api/flying-squad/recent-activities`
- Created `getRecentActivities` function for audit trail

## 📱 Flutter App Changes

### 1. **Updated Flying Squad Dashboard** (`FlyingSquadDashboard.dart`)

#### **API Endpoint Updates:**
- ✅ Added fallback for `/api/flying-squad/qc-pending` → `/api/flying-squad/job-steps/needing-qc`
- ✅ Updated QC check to use new QC-only endpoint
- ✅ Added proper error handling and success messages

#### **UI Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added QC status indicators to job step cards
- ✅ Enhanced step details dialog with QC information
- ✅ Added QC status chips (Completed/Pending)
- ✅ Improved visual feedback for QC operations

#### **New Features:**
- ✅ QC status tracking and display
- ✅ Enhanced step details with QC information
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

### 2. **New Flying Squad Step Update Screen** (`FlyingSquadStepUpdate.dart`)

#### **QC-Only Interface:**
- ✅ Dedicated screen for Flying Squad QC operations
- ✅ Only allows updating QC-related fields
- ✅ Clear warning about Flying Squad restrictions
- ✅ Form validation for QC remarks

#### **Features:**
- ✅ Read-only step information display
- ✅ QC remarks input field
- ✅ Real-time loading states
- ✅ Success/error feedback
- ✅ Automatic data refresh after updates

### 3. **Navigation Updates**
- ✅ Updated step details to navigate to QC update screen
- ✅ Added proper callback handling for data refresh
- ✅ Improved user flow for QC operations

## 🔒 Flying Squad Permissions Summary

### **✅ What Flying Squad CAN Do:**
- **View all job steps** across all departments
- **Update QC fields only**: `qcCheckSignBy`, `qcCheckAt`, `remarks`
- **Access QC statistics** and pending QC steps
- **View recent activities** and audit trail
- **Perform QC checks** on any step

### **❌ What Flying Squad CANNOT Do:**
- **Update step status** (planned, start, stop)
- **Update machine details** or assignments
- **Update step timing** (startDate, endDate, user)
- **Update production fields** (quantity, specifications, etc.)
- **Modify job planning** or workflow

## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. Step Viewing:**
- Flying Squad can view all job steps with QC status indicators
- Steps show both production status and QC status
- Clear visual distinction between completed and pending QC

### **2. QC Operations:**
- Tap on any step to see detailed information
- "Perform QC" button for pending QC steps
- Dedicated QC update screen with form validation
- Only QC-related fields can be updated

### **3. API Integration:**
- Uses new QC-only endpoint: `/api/job-planning/:nrcJobNo/steps/:stepNo/qc`
- Fallback to original endpoint if needed
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic data refresh after updates

### **4. User Experience:**
- Clear visual indicators for QC status
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Proper loading states and feedback
- Warning messages about restrictions

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test the Implementation:**
```bash
# Run the backend test
node test-flying-squad-restrictions.js

# Test the Flutter app
# 1. Login as Flying Squad user
# 2. Navigate to Flying Squad Dashboard
# 3. Try to perform QC operations
# 4. Verify restrictions work correctly
```

## 📋 Files Modified

### **Backend Files:**
- `src/middleware/flyingSquadPermissions.ts` (new)
- `src/utils/roleUtils.ts`
- `src/routes/jobPlanningRoute.ts`
- `src/controllers/flyingSquadController.ts`
- All step controllers (7 files)

### **Flutter App Files:**
- `NRCapp/lib/presentation/pages/dashboard/FlyingSquadDashboard.dart`
- `NRCapp/lib/presentation/pages/stepsselections/FlyingSquadStepUpdate.dart` (new)

## ✅ Status: Complete

All Flying Squad restrictions are now properly implemented in both backend and Flutter app. Flying Squad users can only perform QC operations and cannot modify other step details.
