# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Planner Machine Access Fix

## ✅ Fix Summary
Fixed the `/api/jobs` endpoint returning only 2 jobs for `planner` and `admin` users.

**Root Cause**: The `planner` role was missing from the machine access bypass list, causing planners to be incorrectly filtered by machine assignments.

**Solution**: Added `planner` role to all machine access bypass checks in `src/middleware/machineAccess.ts`.

## 📊 Impact
- **Before**: Planners only saw 2 jobs (filtered by machine assignments)
- **After**: Planners will see ALL 5,923 jobs ✅

### Affected Users (4 users):
1. Sillu (planner@gmail.com) - `planner` role
2. Sudharshan Reddy (planner@nrc.com) - `planner` role  
3. Testing Shankh (multi-role including planner)
4. Himanshu (info@nrcontainers.com) - `admin` role

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/middleware/machineAccess.ts` - Added planner to 9 functions
   - `getUserMachineIds()`
   - `checkJobMachineAccess()`
   - `checkPOMachineAccess()`
   - `addMachineFiltering()`
   - `checkMachineAccess()`
   - `checkJobStepMachineAccess()`
   - `checkJobStepMachineAccessWithAction()`
   - `getFilteredJobNumbers()`
   - `getFilteredJobNumbersCount()`

### Files Created:
1. ✅ `FIX_PLANNER_ADMIN_MACHINE_ACCESS.md` - Detailed fix documentation
2. ✅ `DEPLOY_PLANNER_FIX.md` - This deployment guide

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Build is already complete ✅
npm run build

# 2. Restart the server (based on your deployment)
# For PM2:
pm2 restart nrc-backend

# For direct Node:
# Stop current server, then:
node dist/server.js

# For Docker:
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production Server
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Add planner role to machine access bypass list"

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin main

# 3. Deploy (if using CI/CD, it will auto-deploy)
# Or manually on server:
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart nrc-backend
```

## ✅ Verification

After deployment, test with a planner user:

### Test via API:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://nrprod.nrcontainers.com/api/jobs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <PLANNER_TOKEN>"
```

**Expected**: Should return all jobs (count: 5923) instead of just 2

### Check Server Logs:
Look for this log message when a planner user accesses `/api/jobs`:
```
🔍 [MACHINE FILTERING DEBUG] Admin/Planner/Flying Squad/QC Manager - bypassing machine restrictions
```

## 🔍 Bypass Roles (Complete List)
These roles now see ALL jobs without machine restrictions:
1. ✅ `admin` - Full system access
2. ✅ `planner` - Job planning and management (FIXED)
3. ✅ `flyingsquad` - Quality inspection
4. ✅ `qc_manager` - Quality management
5. ✅ `paperstore` - Paper inventory

## 📝 Testing Checklist
- [ ] Deploy changes to production
- [ ] Login with planner user (planner@gmail.com or planner@nrc.com)
- [ ] Check `/api/jobs` endpoint
- [ ] Verify it returns all jobs (not just 2)
- [ ] Check server logs for bypass message
- [ ] Test with admin user as well
- [ ] Verify other roles still filtered by machines

## 🎯 Expected Results
| Role | Jobs Visible | Filtering |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| admin | ALL (5923) | Bypassed ✅ |
| planner | ALL (5923) | Bypassed ✅ |
| flyingsquad | ALL (5923) | Bypassed ✅ |
| qc_manager | ALL (5923) | Bypassed ✅ |
| paperstore | ALL (5923) | Bypassed ✅ |
| printer | Filtered | By machine |
| corrugator | Filtered | By machine |
| other roles | Filtered | By machine |
